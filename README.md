# Leetcode-study-plan-Data-Structure-I
In computer science, a data structure is a way to store and organize data.  During the computer programming process, identifying and using the appropriate data structure is an important task as it can improve the overall efficiency of the algorithm. In large-scale systems, choosing the most suitable data structure directly impacts the difficulty of program design and the final quality and performance. This repository contains the solutions to Part 1 of Data Structures study plan by Leetcode.
